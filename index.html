      <section class="step" id="intro">
        <div class="title"></div>This story is designed to take a closer look at arms exports and embargoes in countries subject to European Union arms embargoes: China, Myanmar, Syria, North and Iran. Arms exports and arms embargoes data is on <a href="http://www.sipri.org/databases">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>.

        <div class="title">China</div>
       Following the government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the European Union announced an arms embargo against China.

        <div class="title">2 China</div>
        Following the government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the European Union announced an arms embargo against China.
      </section> -->
      <section class="step">
        <!-- <div class="title">3 European Union Countries</div> -->
        However, the <span class="EU">European Union</span> did not set a common position on which arms items would be subject to the embargo, and members interpreted it differently.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
     <!--    <div class="title">4 Russia's Influence</div> -->
        In any case, <span class="russia">Russia</span> has been by far the most important supplier of arms to China since the embargo was imposed.
        When countries don't follow the terms can result in ineffective embargoes, however, symbolic embargoes are often equally ineffective.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Myanmar</div>
        The European Union imposed an embargo on Myanmar in 1991 due to concerns about internal repression, regional instability and other human rights violations. 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <!-- <div class="title">6 Myanmar2</div> -->
        It was merely symbolic, because no <span class="EU">European Union</span> member countries were exporting arms to Myanmar anyway. 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
       <!--  <div class="title">7 China and Russia's influence</div> -->
        <span class="russia">Russia</span> and <span class="china">China</span> have been the main supplier of arms to Myanmar in recent years.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Syria</div>
        In the 1980s, Syria received most of its arms imports from countries in the Soviet bloc, especially Czechoslovakia. 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
      <!--   <div class="title">9 Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div> -->
         Arms imports were low from the end of the Cold War until the years preceding the Syrian civil war. The <span class="EU">Eupean Union</span> imposed an arms embargo in 2011. But <span class="russia">Russia</span> continued to supply arms to the Assad regime.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">North Korea</div>
         Countries in the communist bloc supplied large quantities arms to North Korea in the 1980s. But that largely ceased with the end of the Cold War. 
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <!-- <div class="title">11 North Korea</div> -->
        It response to a claimed nuclear test by North Korea in 2006, the <span class="EU"> European Union</span> impose embargoes on North Korea.
         However, by the time the embargoes were imposed, almost all international arms exports to this pariah state had already ceased.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Iran</div>
         Due to concerns over Iran's nuclear programme the EU imposed a full arms embargo on Iran in 2007.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <!-- <div class="title">13 Iran</div> -->
          Once again it was merely symbolic, no <span class="EU">European Union</span> member countries were exporting arms to Iran.
